Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied
The if...elif...else statement is used in python for decision making

1)if statement :
Syntax --->
if test expression :
    statement(s)
if the test expression gives true result then its corresponding statements gets executed otherwise that part of code gets skipped by the interpretor

Note:Indentation(White space) is used to delimit the block of code

2)if....else statement:
Syntax --->
if test expression :
    Body of if
else:
    Body of else 

The if...else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of if only when the test condition is True.
If the condition is False, the body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.

3)if...elif...else statement:
if test expression:
    Body of if
elif test expression:
    Body of elif
else: 
    Body of else

The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions.
If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.
If all the conditions are False, the body of else is executed.
Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.
The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.
