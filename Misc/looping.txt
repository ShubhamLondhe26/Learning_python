There are two ways to create loops in Python: 
with the for-loop and the while-loop

for loop in python:
>>for loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. 
>>The for-loop is always used in combination with an iterable object, like a list or a range
>>When we have a for loop inside another for loop, itâ€™s called a nested for loop

Syntax:
for iterator_var in sequence:
    loop Body

while loop in python:
>>while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
>>when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed

Syntax :
while expression:
    statement(s)
    
break and continue in Python:
>>The break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present
>>The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only
>>Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration

range() function:
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number
Syntax:range(start, stop, step)
