LIST:(enclosed by [])(built-in-function)
list is a mutable sequence type
list is a sequence data type which is used to store the collection of data
list items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

Index:
Every list with elements has a position or index. 
Each element/item of the list can be accessed by using the index number.
They are two types of indexing :Positive Indexing & Negative Indexing
Note:The list of positive index always starts with 0.Hence, the first element of a list is present at index 0, not 1.
Negative index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.

Slicing :
You can also access the elements from a specific range.
syntax: [ : ]
Note:When we slice lists,start of index (included) and end (excluded)

Concatenation :Using + operator
The '+' operator can be used to concatenate two lists. It appends one list at the end of the other list and results in a new list as output.
